__ztemplates-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT (Not yet released)__ 

* modified ZProperty, ZSelectProperty and ZFormSelect to use ZIFormatter and ZIMarshaller
* added ZIMarshaller and ZIFormatter and diverse implementations for modular and reusable Properties  
* change ZIFormAction no longer has a type parameter 
* removed method ZIFormAction.beforeForm because form could be named other than "form" and would require inutile override of beforeForm   
* added class ZTemplatesRunnable so you can use ztemplates outside a http request, in tests, jobs etc.
* removed class ZISecureUrlDecorator, specify the complete url now
* removed ZIFormAction.getForm() because now the field can be accessed directly by the framework 
* added support for multiple forms in the same action, use ZMatch annotation
* added ZPropertyException to ZProperty.parse/getValue/getValues method to allow better automatic error handling in validations.
* added methods ZIFormService.serializeForm() and deserializeForm
* refactored ZMessages
* added class ZMessagesJSON that converts the messages to JSON
* added ZProperty.requiredValidator to allow override of required validation message
* added ZProperty.updateValue and updateStringValues methods. These methods aid integration with [zdependency|https://sourceforge.net/projects/zdependency/] framework for form value updates
* added ZIRenderService method public T createRenderPojo(Class<T> clazz) to add spring support for render pojos. Now you can create smart pojos if you must.
* added interface ZIActiveView that provides a beforeRendering() method to render pojos. The callback is called in the rendering process before the values are exposed to the template. 
* added support for boolean and long parameter value injection in actions.
* added new createJavascriptId method to ZIRenderService
* added init property (servletContext.getInitParameter()) 'ztemplates.devMode.html.comments' that adds html comments with debug infos to the output. Comments will be generated only when ZRenderer.mimeType is set, and only for mime-type text/html and text/javascript.
* added annotation ZMatch.requiresProtocol (@ZMatch.Protocol.HTTP/HTTPS) where you can specify that a action needs to be called under a specified protocol. If not sends a redirect to the correct protocol.
* added init property (servletContext.getInitParameter()) 'ztemplates.url.prefix.https' and 'zemplates.url.prefix.http' that are added when creating urls with ZIActionService. If set these are propended to urls. If Action is annotated with @ZSecure it will use https otherwise http. 
* added property ztemplatesCssDigest that can be used from templates when ZRenderEngine.zscript is set to true to reload ztemplates.css from the browser only if content changed.

__ztemplates-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT (Released)__ 

* added support for jquery.ajax 'feature' that creates parameter names like 'name[]'. ztemplates will remove the trailing [] so you can use a private String[] name in your actions code to match that value. 
* now can use private fields in Actions for request parameters, no need to declare getter and setter anymore
* added method ZIRenderService.render(JSONArray)
* added support for context parameter property "ztemplates.devMode" (servletContext.getInitParameter("ztemplates.devMode")) that disables as many caches as possible to support tools like JRebel for no redeploy
* added devMode /ztemplates/devMode/refresh url to refresh most cached data, like url match tree
* added devMode /ztemplates/devMode/actions to show actions and matched urls
* added support for Lists of ZIForms in Forms -> dynamic forms
* added support for spring @Component annotation for classes annotated with @ZScriptDefinition

* added support for zscript javascript library, consists of annotation @ZScriptDefinition
* added  public void initPropertyNames(ZIForm form, String formId) to ZIFormService to allow unique ids in forms when using multiple forms on the same page

* now can expose private fields in view pojos, takes precedence over methods
* added SPRING_NAME constants to spring compatible beans/services

__ztemplates-2.1.0 (Released)__
* fixed a bug that happens when creating urls from outside a http request (like a Job, Quartz or Timer)
